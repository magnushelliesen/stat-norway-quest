## Goal
The game will _hopefully_ include the following elements (the list is not extensive):
- Talking to colleagues
- Carrying data around
- Manipulating a production pipeline and a macro model
- Writing analyses
- Talking to media
- Eating lunch
- Eating cake on Fridays
- Drinking coffee
- Attending X-mas party

## Why
This is my honest attempt at learning C++. My plan is to read up on concepts as the project progresses and I need them. If the code sucks, it's because I'm learning.
